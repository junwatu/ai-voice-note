# Building AI Voice Note

![cover](images/voice-note-ai.webp)

This project leverages[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for its backend, utilizing its non-blocking, event-driven architecture to ensure our AI Voice Note application is fast and scalable. We're integrating [GridDB](https://docs.griddb.net/latest/about/what-is-griddb/) for data storage, chosen for its high performance and scalability when dealing with large sets of structured data, making it ideal for handling the complex and voluminous data generated by voice notes. [OpenAI's Speech to text APIs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text) are at the core of our application, enabling advanced natural language processing capabilities that allow for transcription, analysis, and categorization of voice notes. By combining these technologies, we aim to create a robust, efficient tool that simplifies note-taking, turning spoken language into organized, easily retrievable information.

## How it Works?

![project architecture](images/project-architecture.png)

The architecture of the AI Voice Note application can be simplified into a few steps:

1. Users record audio through a web interface, which then sends the audio data to a Node.js server.

2. Node.js processes this data and saving the recordings as MP3 files in persistent storage.

3. Simultaneously, Node.js interacts with OpenAI's API to transcribe the audio to text and categorize the content.

4. The transcribed and categorized data is then stored in GridDB, a scalable NoSQL database.

The process flow is a bidirectional interaction between Node.js and both the database and the AI service, this make Node.js acts as the central hub for data management and processing within the application.
